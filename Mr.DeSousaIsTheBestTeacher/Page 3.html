	<strong>1.) When did they live? Where did they live?<br></strong>
		Born September 5 or 6, 1766, Eaglesfield, Cumberland, England<br><br>

	<strong>2.) What new information did they contribute to the understanding of the atom?<br></strong>
		Dalton's experiments on gases led to his discovery that the total pressure of a mixture of gases amounted to the sum of the partial pressures that each individual gas exerted while occupying the same space.<br><br>

	<strong>3.) How did they find this new information? (What experiments did they do?)<br></strong>
		Dalton's interest in atmospheric pressures eventually led him to a closer examination of gases. While studying the nature and chemical makeup of air in the early 1800s, Dalton learned that it was not a chemical solvent, as other scientists had believed. Instead, it was a mechanical system composed of small individual particles that used pressure applied by each gas independently.<br><br>
