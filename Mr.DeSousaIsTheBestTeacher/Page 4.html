	<strong>1.) When did they live? Where did they live?<br></strong>
		Born December 18, 1856, Cheetham Hill, Manchester<br><br>

	<strong>2.) What new information did they contribute to the understanding of the atom?<br></strong>
		All atoms contain tiny negatively charged subatomic particles or electrons.<br><br>

	<strong>3.) How did they find this new information? (What experiments did they do?)<br></strong>
		Cathode rays are glowing beams of light that follow an electrical discharge in a high-vacuum tube. And when Thomson passed the rays through the vacuum, he was able to measure the angle at which they were deflected and calculate the ratio of the electrical charge to the mass of the particles. He discovered that the ratio was the same regardless of what type of gas was used, which led him to conclude that the particles that made up the gases were universal.<br><br>
