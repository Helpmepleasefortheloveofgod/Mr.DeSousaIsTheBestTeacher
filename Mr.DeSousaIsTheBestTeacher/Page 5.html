	<strong>1.) When did they live? Where did they live?<br></strong>
		Born August 30, 1871, Nelson, New Zealand<br><br>

	<strong>2.) What new information did they contribute to the understanding of the atom?<br></strong>
		Most of the atom is empty space surrounding a tiny nucleus.<br><br>

	<strong>3.) How did they find this new information? (What experiments did they do?)<br></strong>
		A radioactive source emitting alpha particles (i.e., positively charged particles, identical to the helium atom nucleus and 7,000 times more massive than electrons) was enclosed within a protective lead shield. The radiation was focused into a narrow beam after passing through a slit in a lead screen. A thin section of gold foil was placed in front of the slit, and a screen coated with zinc sulfide to render it fluorescent served as a counter to detect alpha particles. As each alpha particle struck the fluorescent screen, it produced a burst of light called a scintillation, which was visible through a viewing microscope attached to the back of the screen. The screen itself was movable, allowing Rutherford and his associates to determine whether or not any alpha particles were being deflected by the gold foil.<br><br>
